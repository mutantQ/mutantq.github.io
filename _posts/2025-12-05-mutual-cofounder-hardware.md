**We make digital content provably authentic at the hardware level.**

AI-generated media is indistinguishable from reality. Software detection doesn't work. At mutual, we're building cryptographic signing directly into camera hardware—so content is authenticated the moment it's captured, before it ever touches software.

## Backed By

**Kay Kyungsik Woo** — Founder & CEO of [MVL Foundation](https://mvlchain.io), the company behind TADA, a blockchain-based ride-hailing platform operating across Southeast Asia. Kay brings deep experience in building trust infrastructure for real-world applications.

## What You'll Build

- Cryptographic accelerators on FPGA (AES-GCM/CCM, authenticated encryption)
- Secure pipelines between image sensors and trusted execution environments
- Reference implementation for our SRA (Signing Right Away) architecture

## Requirements

- Verilog or HDL experience
- Can go full-time between Winter 2025 – Spring 2026

## Nice to Have

- Crypto accelerator design experience
- MIPI CSI-2 / camera interface knowledge

## What We Offer

- **Up to 20% equity** — true co-founder stake
- **Hybrid-remote** — work remotely, but able to be in Seoul periodically for in-person collaboration
- Hard technical problem with real-world impact
