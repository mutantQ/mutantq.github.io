The translated essay was fully reviewed and revised by myself.</em></p> <h2 id="a-thought-experiment">A Thought Experiment</h2> <p>What if the clouds in the sky were like human thoughts? What if clouds were as diverse and complex as human thinking? What if they were that complicated and colorful?</p> <p>This question might seem whimsical at first, but it opens up a profound exploration of what makes consciousness special—or whether it’s special at all. By examining the similarities and differences between clouds and thoughts, we can gain insight into the nature of mind and complexity.</p> <h2 id="striking-similarities">Striking Similarities</h2> <p>Clouds and thoughts share remarkable similarities: both are large structures built from countless small components.</p> <h3 id="local-interactions-global-patterns">Local Interactions, Global Patterns</h3> <p>Water molecules in clouds interact only with their immediate neighbors. When cohesion grows strong enough, they form droplets and eventually massive structures—clouds. No single molecule understands the cloud it helps create, yet through countless local interactions, coherent patterns emerge at grand scales.</p> <p>Neurons work similarly. Each is functionally simple, interacting primarily with nearby neurons. Yet these locally simple structures don’t just internalize the real world effectively—they possess complexity that lets us imagine things beyond reality. This naturally evokes clouds.</p> <h3 id="transience-and-flow">Transience and Flow</h3> <p>Clouds and thoughts also share the quality of constant formation and dissolution. In meditation, visualizing thoughts as clouds is one of the most common techniques for organizing and clarifying the mind. Mindfulness practitioners are often instructed to observe thoughts as clouds passing through the sky—acknowledging them without clinging, watching them drift by without judgment.</p> <p>This metaphor works because both phenomena share fundamental characteristics:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Emergence</strong>: Both arise from simpler components without a central controller</li> <li> <strong>Impermanence</strong>: Both continuously form and dissolve</li> <li> <strong>Pattern formation</strong>: Both create recognizable structures despite underlying chaos</li> <li> <strong>Context-dependence</strong>: Both are shaped by their environment (atmospheric conditions / neural context)</li> </ul> <h2 id="the-essential-question">The Essential Question</h2> <p>So what differentiates thoughts from clouds? Are they essentially the same thing? If not, what distinguishes them?</p> <p>This matters more than it first appears. If thoughts are “merely” complex physical patterns like clouds, what does that mean for consciousness, free will, and human significance? Conversely, if thoughts differ fundamentally from clouds, what makes them special?</p> <h2 id="difference-1-non-local-connectivity">Difference 1: Non-Local Connectivity</h2> <p>Thoughts can form less local connections—the ability to integrate one thought with another is exceptional. If we define distance by connection strength, thoughts might still seem similar to clouds.</p> <p>But here’s the crucial distinction: clouds are constrained by physical proximity. Water molecules interact primarily with immediate neighbors. Neural connections, however, can span different brain regions. Your visual cortex neurons can connect with your prefrontal cortex, letting you consciously reflect on what you see. Clouds can’t do this.</p> <h2 id="difference-2-dimensionality-and-information-density">Difference 2: Dimensionality and Information Density</h2> <p>Forming connections in various directions requires large, complex dimensions. The brain may store higher-dimensional information using fewer resources than expected.</p> <p>The ‘information’ here isn’t neural activity itself, but information stored in connections. When neural activity has dimension $n$, connection information has dimension comparable to an entropy-coded adjacency matrix with $n^2$ elements.</p> <p>My hypothesis: <strong>richer, more diverse connections between components make complex phenomena like thought emerge more readily</strong>.</p> <h3 id="the-connectivity-advantage">The Connectivity Advantage</h3> <p>Consider: a cloud with $N$ water molecules has connectivity roughly proportional to $N$ (each molecule interacts with a few neighbors). A brain with $N$ neurons can have connectivity proportional to $N^2$ through synapses—and these connections have variable strengths that can be modified through learning.</p> <p>This difference in connectivity structure may be crucial:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Clouds</strong>: Fixed, local interaction rules</li> <li> <strong>Brains</strong>: Plastic, potentially long-range connections with modifiable strengths</li> </ul> <p>The brain thus possesses a kind of “programmable matter” property that clouds lack.</p> <h2 id="difference-3-functional-purpose-and-selection-pressure">Difference 3: Functional Purpose and Selection Pressure</h2> <p>Perhaps the most profound difference is this: <strong>thoughts have been shaped by evolution to serve survival purposes, while clouds have not</strong>.</p> <p>Neural circuits exist because they helped our ancestors:</p> <ul> <li>Predict future events</li> <li>Model other minds</li> <li>Plan complex actions</li> <li>Learn from experience</li> <li>Communicate abstract ideas</li> </ul> <p>Clouds, for all their complexity, don’t do anything “for” anything. They have no goals, purposes, or selected-for functions. Their patterns are directionless—shaped only by thermodynamics and fluid dynamics, not by eons of selection for information processing.</p> <p>This teleological dimension—purpose shaped by evolution—may transform mere complexity into something we recognize as thought or intelligence.</p> <h2 id="the-question-of-information-capacity">The Question of Information Capacity</h2> <p>Two intriguing questions emerge:</p> <p><strong>How much information can be stored in a cloud?</strong></p> <p>If we consider a cloud’s information content, we might measure:</p> <ul> <li>Position and momentum of every water molecule</li> <li>Temperature distribution</li> <li>Electric charge distribution</li> <li>Phase information (vapor vs. liquid vs. ice)</li> </ul> <p>This would be enormous—perhaps comparable to a brain’s information. But crucially, <strong>this information isn’t organized to represent anything else</strong>. It doesn’t encode memories, concepts, or world models. It simply is.</p> <p><strong>Why is the sky beautiful after a storm passes?</strong></p> <p>The same holds for human thought. After turbulent periods—emotional storms, intellectual struggles—clarity and beauty often follow. The parallel is striking: both systems, when allowed to dissipate unstable high-energy states and settle into coherent patterns, produce something we perceive as beautiful or meaningful.</p> <p>Perhaps beauty emerges at the edge between chaos and order, in both physical and mental spaces.</p> <h2 id="microexperience-and-global-consciousness">Microexperience and Global Consciousness</h2> <p>Here’s a speculative framework that might bridge these ideas:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Your consciousness is the global connection between microexperiences.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Any sufficiently complex system might have microexperiences, but not necessarily consciousness. Consciousness is a global phenomenon—it can only be understood as a system. Microexperiences, by contrast, form locally and follow local rules.</p> <p>This suggests:</p> <ul> <li>Water molecules in clouds might have primitive “microexperiences”—some minimal “what it’s like” to interact with neighbors</li> <li>Individual neurons might have microexperiences—the “feel” of firing or being inhibited</li> <li>But <strong>consciousness emerges from globally integrating</strong> these microexperiences</li> </ul> <p>A cloud has countless microexperiences but no global integration, no unified field of experience. A brain has both—local neural events that somehow bind together into unified conscious experience.</p> <h2 id="the-hard-problem-remains">The Hard Problem Remains</h2> <p>Even with all these differences, we still face what philosopher David Chalmers called the “hard problem of consciousness”: Why does information processing in brains give rise to subjective experience—to what it <em>feels like</em> to be conscious—while (presumably) clouds don’t experience anything at all?</p> <p>The differences we’ve identified—non-local connectivity, information density, evolutionary purpose, global integration—may be necessary for consciousness, but are they sufficient? Why should any physical system, however complexly connected, have an inner life?</p> <p>This remains one of the deepest mysteries in science and philosophy.</p> <h2 id="implications-for-ai">Implications for AI</h2> <p>These reflections on thoughts and clouds have direct relevance for artificial intelligence:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Connectivity matters</strong>: Deep neural networks with rich connectivity might be more “thought-like” than simple rule-based systems</li> <li> <strong>Purpose matters</strong>: AI systems with goal-directed behavior shaped by training might be more “thought-like” than pure pattern matchers</li> <li> <strong>Integration matters</strong>: Systems with global workspace architectures might be more “thought-like” than collections of isolated modules</li> </ol> <p>But the hard problem remains: At what point, if ever, does an artificial system transition from being a very complex “cloud” to being a genuine “thought”? Do our current AI systems have microexperiences? Will they ever have global consciousness?</p> <h2 id="meditation-and-the-cloud-metaphor-revisited">Meditation and the Cloud Metaphor Revisited</h2> <p>The meditation tradition’s cloud metaphor gains new depth through this analysis. When we observe thoughts as clouds:</p> <ul> <li>We recognize their <strong>emergent nature</strong> (they arise from neural dynamics beyond our direct control)</li> <li>We acknowledge their <strong>transience</strong> (constantly forming and dissolving)</li> <li>We practice <strong>non-attachment</strong> (letting them pass without grasping)</li> <li>We discover the <strong>space</strong> in which they appear (awareness itself)</li> </ul> <p>Perhaps the deepest teaching: consciousness is not identical to thoughts. Thoughts are clouds; consciousness is the sky in which clouds appear and disappear. The sky remains whether clouds are present or absent, stormy or clear.</p> <h2 id="conclusion-same-yet-different">Conclusion: Same Yet Different</h2> <p>So are thoughts and clouds the same? In their basic mechanism of emergence from local interactions—yes, they’re remarkably similar. Both show how complexity can arise from simplicity, how patterns can emerge without a pattern-maker.</p> <p>But in connectivity, information density, evolutionary purpose, and potential for unified experience, they differ profoundly. Thoughts are clouds with a difference—clouds sculpted by billions of years of evolution to represent, predict, choose, and perhaps to feel.</p> <p>The storm-cleared sky is beautiful. So are human thoughts—in their clarity after confusion, in moments of insight and understanding. Perhaps what separates thoughts from clouds isn’t kind but degree: how much integration, how much purpose, how much recursive self-representation.</p> <p>Or perhaps consciousness represents something genuinely new in the universe: <strong>matter so intricately organized it can experience itself</strong>.</p> <hr> <p><strong>Reflection Questions</strong></p> <ol> <li>Do you think consciousness is fundamentally different from complex physical processes, or is it just a very sophisticated form of them?</li> <li>Can you observe your own thoughts as clouds? What do you discover in the “sky” behind them?</li> <li>If we created an artificial system with brain-like connectivity and integration, would it be conscious? How would we know?</li> </ol> <p><strong>Visualizer</strong></p> <ul> <li>Watch: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mi80Nk4ZPGg?feature=shared" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Are Clouds Thoughts?</a> </li> </ul> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/signing-right-away/">Signing Right Away</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/ai-science-and-humanities/">AI, Science, and the Humanities</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2023/rl-introduction-to-pettingzoo-1f62ce393bc3449abd16466/">Introduction to PettingZoo</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2023/rl-deepmind-x-ucl-7-function-approximation-86cf033e13/">DeepMind X UCL | 7.
