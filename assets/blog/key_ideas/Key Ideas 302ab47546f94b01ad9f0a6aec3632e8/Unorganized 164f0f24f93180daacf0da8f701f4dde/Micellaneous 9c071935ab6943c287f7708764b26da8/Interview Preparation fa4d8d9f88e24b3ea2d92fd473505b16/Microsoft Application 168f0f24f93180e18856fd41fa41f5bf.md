# Microsoft Application

Dear Microsoft,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Researcher position at Microsoft, as posted on your careers page. With a robust interdisciplinary background in Physics, Computer Science, and a passionate focus on the societal implications of AI, I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to Microsoft's efforts in creating responsible AI technologies that are grounded in physical principles and social good.

AI is exotic since it allows for a mental model to be saved, sent, interrupted and analyzed. I believe that safe AI could be realized only when the objective

Throughout my career, I have embraced a holistic approach to problem-solving. My experience as a Physics researcher equipped me with a deep understanding of complex systems and data analysis, while my Computer Science expertise allows me to implement computational models and simulations to explore innovative solutions. Notably, my work in developing an open-source platform for collaborative AI research has been pivotal in fostering an inclusive environment for global researchers to address ethical AI challenges.

My dedication to the social impacts of AI has been the driving force behind my professional endeavors. I have actively engaged in community outreach programs that educate on AI literacy, aiming to bridge the gap between technical solutions and societal needs. This dedication aligns with Microsoft's commitment to leveraging AI for the betterment of society, as evidenced by your numerous initiatives on ethical AI practices.

At Microsoft, I am particularly attracted to the interdisciplinary nature of your research teams and the company's holistic approach to technology development. I am eager to contribute my varied expertise to help advance Microsoft's mission of empowering individuals and organizations through technological innovation that is conscious of societal impact and ethical responsibility.

I am looking forward to the possibility of discussing how my diverse skill set and interdisciplinary knowledge can be an asset to Microsoft's research team. Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the potential to contribute to your innovative projects and collaborative initiatives.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

I'll just take the Large Foundation Models Researcher position as an example, and explain whether I'm suitable for the the task:

- Identifying and driving new research directions, creating new technologies and collaborating with Microsoft product groups and external partners to deploy them in real-world settings.
    - Identifying research directions is what I believe is my core strength. I consider myself a generalist who can connect seemingly disparate thoughts. I'm familiar with tinkering new prototypes on my own, but I would need assistance with professional development.
- Stay current with the latest trends, research, and developments in AI, machine learning, and system architecture to ensure our systems remain at the forefront of innovation.
    - This is what I've always been doing and am fascinated about. I've been following tech trends since I was 9 years old, and over the years I have perfected my understanding of technology based on my physical intuition.
- Publish research findings in peer-reviewed journals, conferences, and other relevant venues, and present research results to internal and external stakeholders.
    - I've collaborated with two other students from different backgrounds, and have presented early results to stakeholders (professors). Although I have experience publishing my research for ISEF when I was a high schooler, it'd be embarrassing to show them this 😂. I've led a lot of projects, but am not sure which one could impress the recruiter.
- Collaborate with industry partners and academic institutions to drive joint research projects and initiatives.
    - I am a good collaborator, and enjoy having tech-talks with others! I am leading a research project now and although there were ups and downs we are making significant progress, and have learned to cooperate with people with completely different backgrounds.
