The **reason** why I applied:

I am a person who can relate to people who are suffering, and can make a positive impact through this position. My father was diagnosed 4th stage lung cancer when I was 14. He is still alive and well to this date, thanks to advanced medicine, and my dream is to apply my expertise in technology to the medical domain.

I know how it feels like to have a family member who is ill.

I am very **professional** and **responsible** at what I do, and have experience handling funding over $10,000.

Graduating from a top university in South Korea, I am an extraordinary communicator, and using my skills I have contacted numurous professionals in the pharmaceutical industry through LinkedIn.

I am **bilingual** in English and Korean, which makes me a perfect fit for this position. I was born in Korea but had experience talking in English since I was 9, and have improved my skills over the years by watching YouTube / reading news and debating in English. With knowledge of AP biology and chemistry and interest in Medical AI, I know a lot of medical terminology in both languages.

When I become curious about a symptom or an illness, I tend to first look it up in Korean and then search again in English to find out more information.
