# ACSS Lab - How it’s all connected

# Core thoughts

### Knowledge = Connection + Logic.

- My love for Physics

### Deep neural networks = Universal function approximators.

- Amazing!

### Reinforcement learning = The study of optimal decision making.

- Bellman operators

# Track 1: Reinforcement Learning

## Project SOUL - KFAS

- KFAS: Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies
- SOUL: Seek Our Ultimate Limits
    - Learn to become an interdisciplinary researcher / leader
- RL = a good starting point!
    - Involves computers (AI) / economics (optimal policy) / politics (multi-agent)

## Key problem

- Global imbalances leads to financial crises.
    - example: The Asian Financial Crisis (1997)
- Keynes: Proposed the Bancor + International Clearing Union
- Was not accepted - Bretton Woods System was used (mid-1940s ~ early-1970s)
- US ran out of gold - still, the USD remains as the fiat currency
- Result: Huge foreign exchange reserves, massive trade deficit for the US.

## Objective

- Implement the transition dynamics of:
    - The current floating exchange-rate system
    - A modernized version of the Bancor System + International Clearing Union (proposed)
- Hope: RL agents (=nations) will naturally exploit the weaknesses of our proposed system
    - Provides more feedback, exposing rooms for improvement
- Independent Q-learning is compatible with the concept of anarchy (international politics)
    - each country seeks for it’s own best interest, no other hierarchically superior power exists

## Challenges

- MARL - the system dynamics are unstationary (for the independent learner)
- The system often experiences “jumps between modes”
    - before / after a international agreement (Bancor)
    - when an highly-influential agent changes its policy abruptly (Nixon shock)

# Track 2: AI for Science

## My dad in my freshman year

- has 4th-stage lung cancer but is still living well until today
- Had an epilepsy in front of me which left me in utter shock
- Can my effort reach dad (or people like dad?)
    - Applied to Galux - didn’t turn out well
    - Started my Student Designed Major : AI-based Molecular Simulation

## Quantum & Computational Chemistry

- Learned modeling techniques for quantum mechanical interactions within molecules
- Still computationally expensive - ex) DFT calculations are $O(n^3)$, but $n=10^5$.
- Naive human-made approximations << **data-driven approach using deep learning**
    - For further improvement
        - option 1: Cut down experiment costs (~$1 per exp.)
        - option 2: Improve experiment accuracy

## How does RL fit in?

- RL for planning = best option for streamlining experiments
- Kane Tse (HSABC)
    - Biological assessments are inherently noisy and are not the “pretty” experiments that you think of
- Handol Kim (CEO of Variational AI)
    - High-Throughput Screening (using robots to conduct millions of experiment per day) is like throwing spaghetti noodles to the wall and hoping that it will hit the fly
- Planning is not careful enough → should incorporate some kind of intelligence
