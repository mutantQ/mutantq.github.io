Task: Display agents' reward given by a custom pettingzoo multi-agent environment and print them to rllib debug messages.

Steps

Hello! I would be pleased if you could review the job listing I have shared.

I am currently funded by the Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies, and am running a research project modelling international relations and economics using reinforcement learning.

I need your expertise in RL for linking a custom PettingZoo environment to Ray RLlib. Your opinion and guidance will be greatly appreciated.
