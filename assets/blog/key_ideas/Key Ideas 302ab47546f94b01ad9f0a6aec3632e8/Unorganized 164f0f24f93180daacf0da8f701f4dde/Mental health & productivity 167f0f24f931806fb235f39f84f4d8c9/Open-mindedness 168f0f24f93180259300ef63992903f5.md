# Open-mindedness

How can we accept **change?**

Let’s be more **precise** about this. How can we adapt to **unwanted** changes, especially if you’re satisfied with the way it is now?

Hi everyone, I am your host Yejun.

And today I will be talking about a piece of journal that I wrote when I was 7.

To begin, my family had to **move** a lot when I was young.

And as you can guess, as a 7 year old boy I became really sad and depressed, whenever we had to move to another place.

The Christmas after my 7th birthday was the day when our family had to move, but this time, we had to move abroad - to Boston Massachusetts, United States.

We had to live there for a **year** - which almost felt like a decade for me in that age. I didn’t want to go at all - I was just getting started with my friendship back then, and it felt like my life was being interrupted. I simply **could not accept** that I can’t see my friends anymore, so I started to cry, shout, beg, and behaved in the worst way that a kid could do.

Not only that, I asked my parents : “But Dad, where are the **Christmas** presents?” and he said, “Son, Santa Claus can’t come into this plane, because the plane has to be airtight.”

I can assure you it was my worst day in my 7 years of life.

Having no clue about what it going to happen next, I had to spend **13 hours** in the airplane, without any presents. I watched movies, played games, and eventually I fell asleep, thinking about how bad things would be when I woke up.

But **after** we arrived at our new home, I had to change my mind.

The journal actually saids that “I was so **surprised,** because the house was so pretty.” Not only that, it was my first time living in a 2-story building, which was also very exciting.

And in my journal I started describing the house, as the most beautiful place in the universe - completely ignoring the prejudice I had before.

Eventually, I ended up liking the place even more. I had so many fun episodes there, so many good memories that I had to cry **once more** before I came back to Korea. I learned how to speak English, and the environment had made me speak up **in front the class** very easily. I could actually feel, that I have a **different ego** when I speak in English, which is a much energetic one. Also, I **still contact** the best friends that I’ve met there, and in fact, they are the oldest friends I have.

So, let’s get back to the point. Change seems so bad, **especially** when it involves **giving up something**. Also, we tend to **reject** change if it is uncertain. But the **experience** I had in America meant **so much to me**, so much that I would’ve regretted it if I stayed in Korea. That’s why I now believe that I should be **open-minded to opportunities**, and avoid **any prejudice** that can block myself from making the right decision.

It is within your power to accept the unwanted change and make it into something better.

In the end, some experiences are worth more than the give-away.

Thank you for listening.

- 아이디에이션 단계에서 많은 집단이 공통적으로 겪는 핵심 문제는 새로운 의견에 대한 개방성 부족이다. 흔히 ‘꼰대 기질‘로 불리는 이 특성은 개개인에서도 나타나지만, 집단 내에서 경직된 문화의 형태로 나타나기도 한다. 심각한 경직도를 지닌 집단은 제시된 아이디어를 옳고 그른 것으로 판단(judge)하며, 일정한 기준에 의해 지정된 “잘못된 아이디어“에 대해 인내심이 없어 경청하지 못하며, 심지어 그러한 “잘못된 아이디어”를 내는 사람을 무능하고 악한 사람으로 몰아가기도 한다. 이들은 귀가 열려 있음에도, 마치 노이즈캔슬링 이어폰을 낀 사람처럼 자신의 목소리만 키우고 남의 의견은 듣지 않는다.
