Following the angel investment from Kay Kyungsik Woo (founder & CEO of MVL Foundation), I have started recruiting a hardware engineer co-founder for mutual.  
We are building a hardware-rooted content authenticity infrastructure (SRA, Signing Right Away) that signs camera sensor data at the moment of capture.  
If you are interested, or know someone who might be a good fit, please see the detailed description here: [하드웨어 엔지니어 공동창업자 모집 공고](/blog/2025/mutual-cofounder-hardware-kr/).
