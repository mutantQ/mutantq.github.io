After presenting SRA and the mutual vision on November 4, 2025, I received an angel investment decision on November 6, 2025, from Kay Kyungsik Woo (founder & CEO of MVL Foundation, the company behind TADA). :tada:  
If you're curious about the vision and technical details, you can read [Introducing mutual](/blog/2025/introducing-mutual/) and the whitepaper (PDF) [Signing Right Away](/assets/pdf/SRA-2025-10-05.pdf).
